Description: # pyHIARD
        A project to create a comprehensive database of Artificial and real galaxies that can be used for testing the various tilted ring fitting software that is available. 
        
        
        Requires working versions of tirific,casa and sofia2 installed as sofia2 for full functionality
        
        tirific is required for the Artificial branch and can be installed trough kern-suite https://kernsuite.info/ for ubuntu
        The Real Observed Catalogue should work without any external installations as long as no new galaxies are added.
        
        
        Please see the wiki pages for discussion and set up.
        
        Short explanation
        
        create a virtual enviroment
        
        
        python -m venv my_DB_venv
        activate the environment
        
        source my_DB_venv/bin/activate
        
        install pyHIARD
        
        pip install /path to pyHIARD code
        
        cd to the directory where you want the database to exist.
        
        run pyHIARD by typing
        
        pyHIARD
        
        answer the questions about what you want to create.
        
        Note: Degrading large real galaxies to very small ones takes some time due to the convolution and regridding of the cubes.
